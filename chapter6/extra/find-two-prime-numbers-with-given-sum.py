# Find two prime numbers with given sum
# Given an even number(greater than 2), print two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to given number.
# There may be several combinations possible. Print only first such pair.

# An interesting point is, a solution always exist according to Goldbachâ€™s conjecture.
# The idea is to find all the primes less than or equal to the given number N using Sieve of Eratosthenes.
# Python 3 program to find a prime number
# pair whose sum is equal to given number
# Python 3 program to print super primes
# less than or equal to n.

# Generate all prime numbers less than n.
