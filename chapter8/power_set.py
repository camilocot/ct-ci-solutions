# Power Set: Write a method to return all subsets of a set.

# Time complexity: 2^n When we generate a subset, each element has the "choice" of either being in there or not. รง
# That is, for the first element, there are two choices: it is either in the set or it is not. For
# the second, there are two, etc. So, doing {2 * 2 * . . .} n times gives us 2" subsets.

# Space complexity: There are 2" subsets and each of the n elements will be contained in half of the
# subsets(which 2^n-1 subsets). Therefore, the total number of elements across all of
# those subsets is n * 2^n-1.

# Generating P(n) for the general case is just a simple generalization of the above steps. We compute
# P(n-1), clone the results, and then add an to each of these cloned sets.
